# AI Enabled Car Parking Using OpenCV

This project focusses on designing and implementing a web-application that incorporates AI algorithm and OpenCV. 
The application will utilize computer vision techniques to monitor and analyze parking spaces in real-time, 
allowing users to easily find available parking spots and optimize the overall parking experience. 

The web-application will provide a user-friendly interface where drivers can access real-time parking information,
view parking lot occupancy status, and to navigate to the nearest available parking spot.

## The purpose of the project 
1. To improve the User experience
2. To optimize the Parking resource utilization
